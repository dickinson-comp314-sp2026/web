# Detailed schedule and resources

## Class 11

Required reading: WCBC Chapter 9, sections 9.5-end.

Today's PowerPoint (same as last time): [09-finite-automata.pptx](class10/09-finite-automata.pptx).

Optionally, you can gain familiarity with pumping lemma proofs by playing a game within JFLAP. Choose "regular pumping lemma" from the initial JFLAP window. Then choose "computer goes first" (the "you go first" option is also interesting and useful, but we don't explain it further here). Choose one of the languages. Now your job is to force the computer to violate the pumping lemma. JFLAP's notation is as follows: _m_ is the pumping cutoff; _w_ is the string in the language that will have some substring pumped; _i_ is the number of times _w_ will have a substring pumped; _w_ gets partitioned as _w=XYZ_, where _Y_ is the substring to be pumped.


## Class 10

Today's warm-up exercise: [warmup09.docx](class09/warmup09.docx)

Today's PowerPoint: [08-nondeterminism.pptx](class09/08-nondeterminism.pptx).


## Class 8

Announcements:
* Exam web page is now up-to-date with correct information.
* Get new version `wcbc-programs-v2.0.zip` from home page -- includes bug fix for universal.py 

Required reading: WCBC Chapter 7, sections 7.6-end.

Today's warm-up exercise: [warmup08.docx](class08/warmup08.docx)

Today's PowerPoint (same as last time, starting on slide 13): [07-reductions.pptx](class07/07-reductions.pptx).


## Class 7

Announcement: Don't forget that an AI prompt is available to help you with this course. See course home page.

Required reading: WCBC Chapter 7, sections 7.1-7.5.

Today's warm-up exercise: [warmup07.docx](class07/warmup07.docx)

Today's PowerPoint: [07-reductions.pptx](class07/07-reductions.pptx).




## Class 6

Required reading: WCBC Chapter 6.

Today's PowerPoint: [06-universal-programs.pptx](class06/06-universal-programs.pptx).

Really nice online [cellular automaton simulator](https://devinacker.github.io/celldemo/).

[Ribosome video](https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/groups/ribo/resources/videos/) from LMB Cambridge -- skip to 1:45.

Optional minilab (ungraded, but important and fun):

*   Download the [Universal Turing machine](class06/tu.jff) of Lucas and Jarvis (see also their [explanatory webpage](http://www.itss.brockport.edu/~jlucas/jarvis/JFLAP/examples/e2/pg0.html) if you're interested).
*   Create a LastBtoA machine, similar to LastTtoA from the previous class, but using only the alphabet `a,b` (and blanks). If this isn't clear, you can also use the provided version of [LastBtoA](class06/LastBtoA.jff). We will use LastBtoA as an input to the Lucas and Jarvis Universal Turing machine.
*   Encode LastBtoA so that it is suitable for input to the Lucas and Jarvis Universal Turing machine. An [explanation of the encoding](class06/example-encoding-of-turing-machine.pdf) is provided. Lucas and Jarvis provide [another explanation](http://www.itss.brockport.edu/~jlucas/jarvis/JFLAP/examples/e2/pg1.html) on their website.
*   Test your encoding using the Universal Turing machine and an appropriate input string. In JFLAP, the best way to run this test is to first save your input to a text file, then use the "multiple inputs (transducer)" option from the "input" menu.



## Class 5

Warmup:
* Install JFLAP (see [JFLAP](#jflap) instructions below)

Announcements:
* If printing code from VScode, save toner by printing with a white background -- use _Preferences: Toggle between Light/Dark Themes_.
* If formatting code within Microsoft Word, make sure to use a fixed width font (e.g., Consolas or Courier) for accurate indentation, and find the "Remove Space After Paragraph" option to ensure single spacing.
* Icebreaker exercise: back row of students, be ready to state your name and your favorite Dickinson course outside COMP/MATH/DATA -- state the name and the instructor of the course.
* This is how to interpret graded homework assignments:
  - First, remember that only a random subset of questions are graded. Second, usually some points are awarded for completeness (i.e. reasonable attempts at the questions that were not graded). The score written on your homework will look something like "14/14 + 10c = 24/24". That means the graded questions were worth a total of 14 points and you scored 14/14. In addition, 10 points were awarded for completeness. Your total score was 24/24. So, the letter "c" in "10c" stands for "completeness".
* Homework solutions are available on Moodle.
  - Also, we will go over a couple of homework mistakes in class.

Required reading: WCBC Chapter 5.

### JFLAP

To download JFLAP, follow the instructions at [jflap.org](http://jflap.org/getjflap.html) (you will be asked to fill out a short form). The best version for this course is JFLAP7.1.jar from Jul 27, 2018.

**If the JFLAP website is down you can get [JFLAP on Moodle](https://lms.dickinson.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=1384071) instead**

**If JFLAP won't run when you click on it, open a terminal, navigate to the directory where you have saved the file `JFLAP7.1.jar`, then enter the command**
```
java -jar JFLAP7.1.jar
```
(Of course, you need to have Java installed on your computer for this to work.)

Minilab (ungraded): using JFLAP,

*   experiment with [binary-incrementer.jff](binary-incrementer.jff)
*   Create and test the basic version of LastTtoA (fig 5.3)
*   Create and test the abbreviated version of LastTtoA (fig 5.6)
*   Create and test a machine that processes genetic strings, changing every "c" to a "g" and every "g" to a "c"
*   Optional extras: Create a machine that accepts any string of length 10 or more that also contains an "a".

Today's PowerPoint: [05-turing-machines.pptx](class05/05-turing-machines.pptx).






## Class 4

Announcement: How to get help in this course -- see new link on the main course homepage.

Required reading: WCBC Chapter 4.

Today's warm-up exercise: [04-warmup.docx](class04/04-warmup.docx)

Today's PowerPoint: [04-computational-problems.pptx](class04/04-computational-problems.pptx).

Programs for experimenting with ESS and DESS: [switchAndConcat.py](class04/switchAndConcat.py), [switchAndConcat1Param.py](class04/switchAndConcat1Param.py). (Remember to move these into your `wcbc-programs-v1.1` folder.)



## Class 3

Required reading: WCBC Chapter 3.

Handout for today: [class3-handout.pdf](class03/class3-handout.pdf).

Today's warm-up exercise: [03-warmup.docx](class03/03-warmup.docx)

Today's PowerPoint: [03-impossible-programs.pptx](class03/03-impossible-programs.pptx).


## Class 2

* _Class will take place in Tome 117 today._
* _If campus is closed on Tuesday, class will take place online via Zoom. The link and details are on the course home page._

### Minilab: Using WCBC programs from a different folder

Chapter 2 of the textbook explains how to use programs that are saved and run from same folder as the WCBC utilities. It's fine to work like this, but it becomes difficult to keep your files organized in separate folders. This minilab demonstrates how use the WCBC programs while also storing your own Python files somewhere else. 

* Download and extract [`wcbc-programs-v1.1.zip`](../wcbc-programs/wcbc-programs-v1.1.zip) into your `comp314` folder.
* Download [`use_containsGAGA.py`](class02/use_containsGAGA.py) and organize as follows:
```
comp314
├── classes
│   ├── class01
│   └── class02
│       └── use_containsGAGA.py
├── hw
└── wcbc-programs-v1.1
```
* Open `use_containsGAGA.py` in IDLE or your favorite Python environment. 
* Run it, check that it works correctly, add a few more test strings to the source code and rerun. Note the use of
```python
import sys
sys.path.append('../../wcbc-programs-v1.1')
```
to make the WCBC utils accessible.
* Write your own `use_isEven.py`.
* Write your own `use_countLines.py`. What inputs can you use? How about some files?

### Lecture for today

Required reading: Chapters 1 and 2 of WCBC.

Today's PowerPoint: [02-computer-programs.pptx](class02/02-computer-programs.pptx).


## Class 1

The textbook is called *What Can Be Computed?*, which we abbreviate as
    *WCBC*.
      
Today we will go through the syllabus and an overview of the course,
corresponding to WCBC Chapter 1.

Today's PowerPoint: [01-intro.pptx](class01/01-intro.pptx).
  
If there's time, we will try to run and edit some Python programs
  using IDLE. Key points:

* You can [download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and
    install it on your own laptop etc.
* Python is also available on various college computers, and via online sites such as [pythonanywhere.com](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/).

Here is some code to paste in and experiment with:
```python	
def containsGAGA(inString): 
    if 'GAGA' in inString: 
        return 'yes' 
    else: 
        return 'no' 
```

Here's another one:
```python
def multiply(inString): 
    (M1, M2) = inString.split()
    product = int(M1) * int(M2) 
    return str(product)
```
