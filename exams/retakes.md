# Exam retakes

You can retake any midterm exam, but not the final exam. If you scored 90% or better, then you can't retake the exam. After retaking an exam, your official score for the exam will be computed as the average of your original score and the retake score, but capped at 90%.  

When you retake the exam, you must do it with the same time limit and under the same exam conditions as the original exam. 
(This means no assistance, no devices, and no materials except one page of handwritten notes.) 

You must retake the whole exam, not just the questions that you missed. You can retake the exam at a time and place of your choosing. Note the date, start time, end time, and location on your exam paper.

After completing the retake, grade the exam yourself using the solutions provided, and compute your new total score. 
  
You must then submit your graded, retaken exam to me during office hours or at another time by appointment. Bring your original exam to our meeting too. 
At that time I may quiz you orally on the exam content for up to 15 minutes. If your oral responses don’t justify the new grade, I will reset your exam score to the original score. If I perceive evidence that you violated the exam conditions during the retake, you will be referred to the student conduct system; the sanctions from that system can be very serious.

## Deadlines

1. You must complete the retake within **7 days** of the original exam being returned to students. 
2. You must meet with me to submit the retaken exam (and complete an oral quiz if required) within **14 days** of the original exam being returned to students.
 
You can do as many retakes as you wish within the 7 days allowed, but you can submit your retake only once.
